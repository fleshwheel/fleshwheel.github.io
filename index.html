	<p>my name is liam <i>(they/them)</i> and i’m a 21-year old college student / bicycle mechanic who makes experimental sound art/noise music under the name fleshwheel. i have a background in traditional irish concertina music and a capella performance, though much of my music-making tends to depart from conventional western music theory and practice. some of my biggest personal influences on my music making practice are SOPHIE, Arca, Aphex Twin, and yeule. so far under the fleshwheel name i have released several albums of textural, esoteric, and primarily downtempo noise music produced and performed by me.<br/><br/>
		
In my art, I use old/salvaged/DIY electronics to create my desired sonic texture. Although my initial choice to use a lot of mismatched music gear and a particularly noisy 4-track cassette recorder was a byproduct of what I had available, the unique sonic signatures of the different technologies throughout different eras combined to create something with a sonic texture very distinct from modern mixed and mastered electronic music made in a DAW. In my creative process I enjoy using 4-track recorders or old cheap keyboards with "novelty" presets because they lend themselves to spontaneous creative expression, and in turn they lend a lo-fi quality which reflects the intended scale of my art – very personal and everyday, shrouded by the noise of the circuitry and static. I also incorporate various electronics, whether in the form of using an oscilliscope to visualize signals in 2 dimensions or making DIY resistor-capacitor networks as a sound effects module. Throughout my process, I have taken more of a “circuit-bending” approach to building circuits, using trial and error and qualitative metrics of sound quality instead of existing blueprints. A quote I like by Brian Eno describes how the sonic vocabulary of broken electronics is one that can be uniquely expressive, especially given our postmodern familiarity with technology.

<blockquote>
	Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. It’s the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart. The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them.
</blockquote>

I find a particular sense of importance in experimental electronic music because as a tradition it has always used technology to express, amplify, and communicate strong emotion. Electronic music has roots in the queer, african-american clubs which created house music. Early electronic music pioneers included the afrofuturist movement, who in groups such as Sun Ra’s Arkestra, redefined technology as something through which expert musicians could upset structural racism and oppression. Many trailblazing experimental electronic music producers have been women, and electronic music has deep radical power in its association to feminism. One specific way in which electronic music can be used to express feminist praxis, outlined in “A Cyborg Manifesto” by Donna Haraway, is through a perversion of the boundary between body and technology, and in this an embracement of the uncanny and transcendent. The distortion of biological self is also a complex and deep metaphor for the autistic experience (e.g., “Convenience Store Woman” by Sayaka Murata, Björk’s “Biophilia”).

In my artistic practice, I produce and perform experimental noise music under the name "fleshwheel" and have started to gain a familiarity with the queer noise music scene in Western Massachusetts. Using my electronics skills, I also produce some audio electronics, such as microphones, effects, and a brain electrode headband.	</body>
