	<p>my name is liam <i>(they/them)</i> and i’m a 21-year old college student / bicycle mechanic who makes experimental sound art/noise music under the name fleshwheel. i have a background in traditional irish concertina music and a capella performance, though much of my music-making tends to depart from conventional western music theory and practice. some of my biggest personal influences on my music making practice are SOPHIE, Arca, Aphex Twin, and yeule. so far under the fleshwheel name i have released several albums of textural, esoteric, and primarily downtempo noise music produced and performed by me.<br/><br/>
		
in my art, i use old/salvaged/DIY electronics to create my desired sonic texture. although my initial choice to use a lot of mismatched music gear and a particularly noisy 4-track cassette recorder was a byproduct of what i had available, the unique sonic signatures of the different technologies throughout different eras combined to create something with a sonic texture very distinct from modern mixed and mastered electronic music made in a DAW. in my creative process i enjoy using 4-track recorders or old cheap keyboards with fun presets because they lend themselves to spontaneous creative expression, and in turn they lend a lo-fi quality which reflects the intended scale of my art – very personal and everyday, shrouded by the noise of the circuitry and static. i also incorporate various electronics, whether in the form of using an oscilliscope to visualize signals in 2 dimensions or making DIY resistor-capacitor networks as a sound effects module. throughout my process, i have taken more of a “circuit-bending” approach to building circuits, using trial and error and qualitative metrics of sound quality instead of existing blueprints.<br/><br/>

i find a particular sense of importance in experimental electronic music because as a tradition it has always used technology to express, amplify, and communicate strong emotion. electronic music has its roots in the queer, african-american clubs which created house music. early electronic music pioneers included the afrofuturist movement, who in groups such as Sun Ra’s Arkestra, redefined technology as something through which expert musicians could upset structural racism and oppression. personally, i feel a strong connection to electronic through my own transfeminine identity. in a world where digital existence is as meaningful as physical existence, technology is no longer simply an innocent means of personal computing but also can enforce cruel monetary systems and violent military regimes, i believe that the cyberpunk movement is important to reclaim the ways in which technology may be used for the uniquely magical and human.</p>
