i’m juicing this fruit for all that it’s got
and now i’m learning that it don’t got a lot
once my brain is exhausted and i’ve moved on
it’ll be another mattress by the wayside or a
guitar trapped in a case in the basement
and like this my anxiety sucks the life and color
out of all joy
punctuating sentences with doubts
i wish i could relax but the persistent beat continues in my head
between thoughts flowing and existential dread
what will make me happy and give me that feeling of possession?
i want to break all the structure and order of this tape recorder
desolder the wires, connect them backwards
and then hit record
tunes all around me play ethereal noise
and together they have some kind of poise
responsibility seems like a lot but it’s all that i’ve got and
it’s not so bad
i feel myself around me in my room
