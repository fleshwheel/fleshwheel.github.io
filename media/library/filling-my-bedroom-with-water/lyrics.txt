let the water spill on the table
we’ll clean it up when we are able
there’s ash on my floor
and crumbs in the cracks
and stuff that flew under the door
when i dropped the towel and the air dispersed through the room
every living thing has a place on the wall that it has stayed for centuries and millennium
and to my memory many of them have strayed from the drawers which had fell off a year ago when the moss had climbed before it died
then they cleaned it off with a painter’s towel
and the roller made it sterile
and the roller made it sterile
